<div class = "burger">
  <h2><span>Burger Builder</span> - October 9th, 2020 </h2>
    <p>Burger Builder is my first project ever. This was also the very first project made for my Software Engineering Program. The only requirement was to have the app be a game that was made only of front-end work.</p>
    <p>The game placed players in the shoes of a chef. Players are given one minute to build randomly picked orders from "customers". The burger must be built from the bottom up and sent for inspection. With every correct order players will earn points and any wrong order loses points.</p>
    <p>Play the game here! </br> <a href="https://justjeo.github.io/Burger-Builder/">Burger Builder</a> </p>
